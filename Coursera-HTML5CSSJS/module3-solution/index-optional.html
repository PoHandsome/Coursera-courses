          [MUSIC] Okay, so let's continue building our site, and right now, we're going to concentrate on these buttons right here, these menu items. So let me go back to the code editor, and I'm right now located in lecture 32 after folder I'm looking at the index.html and I'm going to go ahead and scroll down to right below where our navbar header, this one right here so, let's let sublime text help me out here. And show me where that ends. Right here is where it ends. I actually can remove this line and just put it right here. So I need to put it right below where the navbar header ends, because that's now not part of the navbar header that's going to show up when the main menu collapses and kind of disappears, and only is accessible through this toggle button. Okay, so I'm going to go ahead and paste some code that I pre-baked. And let's go over the code. Okay, so the first thing you see is this is the div that contains all of our menus, all of our navigation buttons. And you see the ID that I gave this div is collapsible na, nav. Well, you've seen this before. There it is, collapsible nav. And the way we specify or do a selector API type of ID is we put a pound sign in front of it. So very much the same as CSS. So here, we're saying I want to select pound sign collapsible nav which means ID, that's collapsible nav, well the ID collapsible nav is right here and the collapse.js, we're going to concentrate on these buttons right here, these menu items.
